# FileExfiltration
A modification of Hak5's method of File exfiltration, using an Arduino Pro Micro instead of a rubber ducky


Really, the only thing I did was convert the few lines of duckyscript over to arduino code. All of the credit goes out to @hak5darren and the Hak5 team for developing the payload and tearing their hair out dealing with DOS.
